Okay, so I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Parenting, and OMG, I have thoughts. Like, seriously, the things people do when they think they know what they're doing with kids. You know what I mean? It’s like, parenting 101 is just going with the flow, but everyone’s treating it like a science or some next-level strategy game. And those poor kids, man. You could see it in their eyes sometimes. They’re just like, “Dude, I didn’t sign up for this!”

Anyway, I kinda stumbled onto it. Someone told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , and I just... did it without really thinking. After 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, I'm like, aren’t we all just pretending to be adults most of the time? I don’t know, there were moments I was laughing out loud and then suddenly introspective. Classic, right? Like, let’s be real, nobody knows what they’re doing, not in life, not in parenting. We’re just winging it day by day.

Oh, and the funniest part, the folks act so confident, but underneath, they're all just a bit messed up. Aren’t we all? Feels kind of comforting, actually. Maybe that’s the lesson here, that there shouldn’t be lessons! Just a bunch of stories about people being people.

Here's the thing—(and I mean, it’s not like I have all the answers)—but even as a life coach, it’s like, you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , and you’re like, “Ah, that’s me on a bad day. Or maybe a good one? Who knows.” All these self-help books and whatnot, they make it sound like there’s a secret formula. Spoiler: there isn’t. Just do the best you can without losing your mind, yeah?

So yeah, that’s my immediate brain dump just after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. Might be the lack of sleep or the too-strong coffee talking, but I reckon it’ll all hit different later. Let’s chat more about it when our brains are less fried, yeah? Until then, just keep doing you.
